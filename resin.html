                        <p>When the process starts, the laser “draws” the first layer of the print into the
                            photosensitive resin. Wherever the laser hits, the liquid solidifies. The laser is directed
                            to the appropriate coordinates by a computer-controlled mirror.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this point, it’s worth mentioning that most desktop SLA printers work upside-down. That
                            is, the laser is pointed up to the build platform, which starts low and is incrementally
                            raised.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the first layer, the platform is raised according to the layer thickness (typically
                            about 0.1 mm) and the additional resin is allowed to flow below the already-printed portion.
                            The laser then solidifies the next cross-section, and the process is repeated until the
                            whole part is complete. The resin that is not touched by the laser remains in the vat and
                            can be reused.</p>

                        <p>DLP Printer</p>
                        <p>Now that you know how SLA works, it’s time to take a closer look at DLP. DLP is a “sister
                            technology” to SLA as the only big difference is the light source used to cure the resin. As
                            we just mentioned, SLA printers use lasers combined with galvanometers to cure resin.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With a DLP 3D printer, the light source is a specially developed digital light projector
                            screen. Thanks to this screen, DLP is generally considered to be faster than SLA, and here’s
                            why:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With SLA, the laser has to individually cure the resin in a “point to point” technique. On
                            the other hand, a DLP projector screen flashes an image of a layer all at once! Thus all
                            points of a layer can be cured simultaneously. In this way, the print speed is increased in
                            comparison to SLA since it takes less time to cure a single layer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the DLP is a digital technology, the 2D image that is projected is composed of pixels.
                            When translated into three dimensions, they become voxels.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The light source of a DLP 3D printer itself, an LED screen, means nothing without a digital
                            micromirror device (DMD), the “heart” of every DLP chipset. A DMD contains hundreds of
                            thousands or even millions of small micromirrors that direct the light and create the
                            pattern of a layer onto the bottom of the resin tank.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The resolution of a printed part using a DLP 3D printer usually corresponds to the number of
                            micromirrors inside a DMD device.
