                            <p>The general concept of and procedure to be used in 3D-printing was first described by
                                Murray Leinster in his 1945 short story Things Pass By "But this constructor is both
                                efficient
                                and flexible. I feed magnetronic plastics — the stuff they make houses and ships of
                                nowadays
                                — into this moving arm. It makes drawings in the air following drawings it scans with
                                photo-cells. But plastic comes out of the end of the drawing arm and hardens as it comes
                                ... following
                                drawings

                                It was also described by Raymond F. Jones in his story, "Tools of the Trade," published
                                in
                                the
                                November 1950 issue of Astounding Science Fiction magazine. He referred to it as a

                            <p>In 1971, Johannes F Gottwald patented the Liquid Metal Recorder, U.S. Patent 3596285A, a

                                Inkjet metal material device to form a removable metal fabrication on a reusable surface

                                immediate use or salvaged for printing again by remelting. This appears to be the first
                                patent
                                describing 3D printing with rapid prototyping and controlled on-demand manufacturing of
                                patterns.

                                The patent states "As used herein the term printing is not intended in a limited sense

                                sintering, and selective laser melting) usually went by their own individual names in
                                the
                                1980s
                                and
                                1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that are now called
                                non-additive
                                (casting,
                                fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to
                                those
                                technologies
                                (such as by robot welding and CNC), the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work

                                transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape with a toolpath was associated

                                metalworking
                                only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC
                                EDM,
                                and many
                                others. But the automated techniques that added metal, which would later be called
                                additive
                                manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new

                                for
                                material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including

                                with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing, it is clear to engineers that

                                One place that AM is making a significant inroad is in the aviation industry. With

                                Electric (GE) this means looking towards AM as a way to reduce cost, reduce the number
                                of

                                would not be feasible with the antiquated manufacturing methods. One example of AM
                                integration
                                with

                                As technology matured, several authors had begun to speculate that 3D printing could aid
                                in
                                sustainable
                                development in the developing world.

                                In 2012, Filabot developed a system for closing the loop with plastic and allows for any

                                or

                                As the price of printers started to drop people interested in this technology had more
                                access
                                and
                                freedom to make what they wanted. The price as of 2014 was still high with the cost
                                being
                                over
                                $2,000,
                                yet this still allowed hobbyists an entrance into printing outside of production and
                                industry

                                The term "3D printing" originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material
                                onto
                                a
                                powder
                                bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer. More recently, the popular vernacular has
                                started
                                using
                                the term to encompass a wider variety of additive-manufacturing techniques such as
                                electron-beam
                                additive manufacturing and selective laser melting. The United States and global
                                technical
                                standards use
                                the official term additive manufacturing for this broader sense.

                                As of 2020, 3D printers have reached the level of quality and price that allows most
                                people
                                to enter the
                                world of 3D printing. In 2020 decent quality printers can be found for less than
                                US$200
                                for
                                entry level
                                machines. These more affordable printers are usually fused deposition modeling (FDM)
                                printers.[44] In
                                November 2021 a British patient named Steve Verze received the world's first fully
                                3D-printed prosthetic
                                eye from the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.[45] [46]
